## What is Metabound?

Metabound is a third-person massively multiplayer open world â€˜metaverseâ€™ where players can forge their own path as they find their own playstyles. Immerse yourself in a dynamic storyline spanning over 30,000 years, earn real world money by conquering the in-game economy, slay your way to fame and riches in open world PVP or hey, just hang out with your people in a friendly space.

{% hint style="info" %}
Weâ€™re gamers at heart and one of the driving forces behind the Metabound team is the ability to take community input and rapidly prototype it into the live world to see whether it works or not, weâ€™re able to release new content and iterate new game mechanics with no red tape to get in the way.

&#x20;\
That means an ever evolving and growing game world, constant new content and community input that gets taken seriously. <mark style="color:blue;">Get involved here.</mark>

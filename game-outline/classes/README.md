# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŽ¤ Classes

In time, as part of our roadmap - we're planning to really bring a diverse cast of classes and characters to the Metabound universe. To get things rolling and onboard people into the game, we'll start with four classes, and we'll stick with some of the favourite and most familiar game archetypes.

As with everything, we're totally open to community input on the direction and backstory of the classes. We've got things started with a solid class outline, abilities and core strengths.

Each class has a unique perk based on the class specialization that's chosen, for example - Players who choose the Hunter class, and specialize in Tracking, get the Recon Scan special perk.

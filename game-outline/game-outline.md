## Forge your own path

The greed of the First Humans weighed heavily on the Tasar system for over a millennia before the [<mark style="color:blue;">Reclamation</mark>](../story/reclamation.md) in 8400. Three of the four mega corporations withdrew support for the [<mark style="color:blue;">Federacy</mark>](../story/federacy.md) and took the Tasar system under their own control, building a lawless paradise for their own misaligned trade dealings.\
\
Thatâ€™s where your story begins - your family, overcome by debts (that's how the financial system is designed after all), sold you to the [<mark style="color:blue;">Colonies</mark>](../story/colonies.md). Youâ€™re aboard a transport shuttle heading to Kalâ€™ra to join the frontlines for one of the mighty corporations that currently hold control of the city's resources, Revenant Industries and Eno Logistics.

After making a quick decision that'll seal your fate _forever_, you'll choose from one of four base classes to play. Then forge your own path as you level through class-based talents and specializations with customisation like never seen before in an RPG. Youâ€™ll be able to choose from <mark style="color:blue;">Hunter</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">Reaver</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">Steelbound</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">Technician</mark>, each with their own unique base abilities and special perks to help you along your journey.

### Battle

We donâ€™t want your time in the city to get boring, so aside from [<mark style="color:blue;">being attacked by stray dogs</mark>](wildlife-and-taming.md), youâ€™ll be able to take part in strategic open-world PVP. Donâ€™t worry, youâ€™ll still be able to blindly run into buildings and brainlessly waste everybody in sight if youâ€™re feeling like it.\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>Open world PVP can be a tedious aspect for game developers, how do we balance it with PVE? How do we balance it at all? Can you PVP everywhere? All questions that weâ€™ve really been exploring with the community. So to begin with, our open world PVP will revolve around a capture the flag style faction war that will last for 3 months (a season).\
\
Controlling strategic map locations around the city will give all members of that corporation a passive bonus. For example, capturing the old plastics manufactory grants all members increased crafting production whilst their corporation remains in control.\

\
The winning corporation at the end of the 3 months will receive seasonal based rewards including exclusive items, exclusive titles and currency. Donâ€™t despair! A separate seasonal leaderboard will track players' accomplishments individually based on a point system. <mark style="color:blue;">Please check it all out â†’</mark>\


{% hint style="info" %}
Players will earn Zenith for taking part in active captures, defending controlled locations and killing hostile players.
{% endhint %}

\
In addition to our openworld PVP, youâ€™ll find a whole slew of mini-games, story-driven adventures and paid missions to take part in, either alone, or with a group of friends.

Check them out using the quick links below, or keep following along and we'll get there soon enough.\

### Survive

Littered with the failures of past arrivals, Kalâ€™ra has been torn by greed for centuries. We really wanted to bring a fresher take to the tired survival mechanics in a massively multiplayer open world, and blend them with traditional RPG features to make your experience as enjoyable as possible.\


**Wildlife & Taming**\
The first of which, and the one Iâ€™m most excited to get people testing and tuning - is our crazy dynamic wildlife. Stray dogs, cats and all kinds of alien critters can be found lurking in the alleys and soaring atop the skyscrapers of the city. They can attack you, and you can tame them as pets - some rarer breeds will fetch a high price on the black market.\
&#x20;

{% endcontent-ref %}

****\
**Character Health Requirements**\
The next change we wanted to make was to how you manage your characterâ€™s requirements, it can be a bit tedious at times to have to manage hunger and thirst when youâ€™re hanging out or doing other activities - so we drilled down to some core survival mechanics and will implement items that can help negate their effects, or regenerate naturally.

{% content-ref url="survival-mechanics/character-health.md" %}
[character-health.md](survival-mechanics/character-health.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

\
**Immersive Weather System**\
Weâ€™re also building a state-of-the-art weather system across the whole city and the surrounding tundras, the aim is to bring a fresh mechanic thatâ€™s rarely seen in other games. Think outside the box, lightning strikes, hurricanes, earthquakes and honestly - we're trying to figure out a way that a large wave (tsunami) would be able to come through the city, but also be avoidable - it's tricky.&#x20;

What's even trickier is trying to balance these aspects and drip them into a players experience without ruining it, too much weather is annoying in City Builder games, too little weather leaves an MMO with a bland and lifeless environment.

### Craft

Gathering and crafting stand at the heart of all economies, old and new. Weâ€™ve got a solid background in games like World of Warcraft, EVE, Diablo and Runescape - weâ€™ve all earned our stripes on the auction houses and we have some ideas on how gathering and crafting can be streamlined, rewarding and enjoyable all at the same time. The important thing is, it shouldnâ€™t get in the way of how you want to play the game.\ <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>

{% content-ref url="../economy/gathering/" %}
[gathering](../economy/gathering/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../economy/crafting/" %}
[crafting](../economy/crafting/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

\
We want to reward the gatherers, collecting scrap metal and plastics, and give them a more fluid path to profits as they build the economy from the ground up. Most games split gathering, processing and crafting into 3 jobs (Mining > Smelting > Blacksmithing for example).\
\
Weâ€™re going to give gatherers the responsibility of breaking down and processing materials themselves - but donâ€™t worry, your skills in material processing will level alongside your gathering skills. Streamlined!\


{% content-ref url="../economy/gathering/processing.md" %}
[processing.md](../economy/gathering/processing.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

\
Naturally, we wanted to give crafters a more streamlined process too. Our idea for this was to make the crafting path a little more dynamic to keep it fun, the market varied, and the likelihood of certain items being flooded (and depreciating in value) will be kept to a minimum.\
\
Enter Crafting Trees and Crafting Masteries. A crafting tree works a lot like a talent tree, you level up your crafting profession and unlock different abilities and recipes depending on the path you choose. \


{% content-ref url="../economy/crafting/crafting-tree.md" %}
[crafting-tree.md](../economy/crafting/crafting-tree.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../economy/crafting/crafting-mastery.md" %}
[crafting-mastery.md](../economy/crafting/crafting-mastery.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

\
Crafting masteries are for the most dedicated crafters, leveling through them will test your metal with the wares youâ€™re flogging. Completing your masteries grants increased production, efficiency and a greater chance to craft rarer quality products.\
\
Youâ€™ll choose from a whole host of useful professions to help wrangle control of the economy and earn your way to the top. Everything you can use, equip or consume within Metabound is crafted by another player then bought and sold for Zenith at the in-game <mark style="color:blue;">marketplace</mark>.\


## Classes

Spaces can be published to the whole world, or just some of it, or just to a few very specific people. You can also invite folks to collaborate with you on a space if you're on a community, team, or business plan.

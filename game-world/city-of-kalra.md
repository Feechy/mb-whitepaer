# ðŸŒ† City of Kal'ra

### Kal'ra

Vast and unforgiving, Kalâ€™ra was originally built by the <mark style="color:blue;">first humans</mark> as a mining outpost some 30,000 years ago. A skyscraper-sized steel scaffolded structure perched atop the remains of a collapsed and dying dwarf planet. Rich in Radium, the exposed planet core quickly became the setting of an intergalactic boomtown.\
\
Over time, the outpost evolved and grew as itâ€™s position became a favored trading hub within the system. With an abundance of Radium, manufacturing thrived and the economy flourished. Today, Kalâ€™ra is home to a bustling intergalactic metropolis, <mark style="color:blue;">governed by its own residents</mark> and underpinned by real-world cryptocurrency, Zenith.
